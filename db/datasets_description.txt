1. Data Sources
    - Dog API: This API provides images of dogs.
    - Faker: This Faker generates fake dog breed names.

2. Data Structure
    - Dog model: This table includes image_url and breed_id columns.
    - Breed model: This table include dog breed names.

3. Plan to integrate the different Datasets
    - Use Faker gem to creat dog breeds and save them in the Breed model.
    - Use Dog API to save image_url in the Dog model.
    - Each dog row has a breed_id as a FK, it establishing a relationship between Dog and Breed models.
      For example, when a Dog object is created, it includes an image_url from Dog API
      and also breed_id that references a random breed from the Breed table.
    - They are one to many relationship, which each breed can have multiple dogs associated with it.
